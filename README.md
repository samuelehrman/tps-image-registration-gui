A desktop application for aligning multimodal microscopy data using a thin-plate
spline transformation fitted to matched control points. Built for correlating
EBSD maps with SEM imaging, but it works on any pair of images that share
features, in 2D or across a serial-sectioning stack.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11 or newer. This project is distributed through GitHub
rather than PyPI, so install it from a release or directly from the repository.

**From the latest release** (recommended — download the `.whl` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/lambjames18/tps-image-registration-gui/releases)):

```bash
pip install tpsreg-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

**From the repository:**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lambjames18/tps-image-registration-gui.git
```

If you want to have the package be editable
'''bash
pip install -e "path\to\file\\tps-image-registration-gui"
'''

Either way, launch it with:

```bash
tpsreg
```

Installing into a virtual environment is a good idea if you use Python for
other work:

```bash
python -m venv tpsreg-env
source tpsreg-env/bin/activate     # Windows: tpsreg-env\Scripts\activate
pip install <wheel-or-git-url>
tpsreg
```

### Tk

The interface uses Tkinter, which ships with Python on Windows and macOS but is
a separate package on most Linux distributions:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk        # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter   # Fedora, RHEL
sudo pacman -S tk                  # Arch
```

### Optional extras

The base install is deliberately lightweight — it does not pull in PyTorch.
Everything except automatic point detection works without it: loading data,
placing control points, CLAHE, previewing, and every export path.

| Extra | Install | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `accelerated` | `pip install "tpsreg[accelerated]"` | GPU-accelerated CLAHE and resizing via kornia/torchvision. Falls back to scikit-image without it. |
| `matchanything` | `pip install "tpsreg[matchanything]"` | Automatic control point detection with the pretrained MatchAnything/ROMA model. |

To use MatchAnything you also need the model weights, which are
[downloaded separately](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12L3g9-w8rR9K2L4rYaGaDJ7NqX1D713d/view)
and pointed at from **Auto → Set MatchAnything checkpoint...**. The model runs on
CUDA, Apple Silicon (MPS) or CPU, selected automatically. The first run downloads
additional internal weights.

Only CUDA gets the model's half-precision fast path: it depends on CUDA
autocast, and parts of the model stay in full precision without it. On MPS and
CPU the model therefore runs entirely in float32, which is correct but
appreciably slower and uses more memory. A machine with an NVIDIA GPU is worth
using if you have one.

### Development install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambjames18/tps-image-registration-gui.git
cd tps-image-registration-gui
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pytest
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync
uv run tpsreg
```

## Quickstart

The `demo_data/` directory contains a complete 2D example (an EBSD scan, BSE and
SE micrographs, and pre-picked control points) and a 3D serial-sectioning
example. See [demo_data/README.md](demo_data/README.md) for details.

1. **Load your images.** File → *Open source image...* and *Open destination
   image...*. The **source** is the image that gets warped, so load the more
   distorted one there. Plain images (`.tif`, `.png`, `.jpg`) prompt for a
   modality name; EBSD files (`.ang`, `.h5`, `.dream3d`) load all their
   modalities automatically. Call *Open ... image* again with a different name
   to add more modalities on the same grid.
2. **Set the resolution.** Edit → *Set resolution...*, in microns per pixel for
   both images. Needed for the "Match resolutions" feature and for source-cropped
   export.
3. **Save the project.** File → *Save project...* writes all data, points and
   settings to a single JSON file.
4. **Place control points.** Left-click to add, right-click near a point to
   remove, and drag a point to adjust it. Click the source first, then its
   partner in the destination.
5. **Preview.** View → *View corrected image*. Adjust points and repeat until
   satisfied.
6. **Export.** File → *Export corrected data...*.

Aim for 10–20 points spread evenly across the field of view; more distortion
needs more points. CLAHE and zoom make features easier to match precisely,
"Match resolutions" renders both images at the same feature scale, and
"Link views" keeps the two panels at the same zoom and scroll position.

Before estimating a transform, the control points are checked and anything
that will make the fit fail — too few points, points on top of each other,
points all on one line — is reported with the problem named, rather than
surfacing as a solver error a few seconds later. Points that will merely give
a poor result, such as a cluster in one corner of the image, produce a warning
you can dismiss.

## Interface reference

### Main window

The left and right panels show the source and destination images. The top bar
controls the slice (for 3D data), the displayed modality, CLAHE, zoom, view
linking, and resolution matching. The bottom bar shows status and a progress bar
during long operations.

Left-click places a control point. Right-clicking near one removes the pair.
Dragging a point moves it, which is the quick way to correct a click that
landed slightly off; the whole drag is a single undo step. **Link views** ties
the two panels together so zooming or scrolling one does the same to the other.

### File menu

![File menu](./docs/images/GUI-file-menubar.jpg)

Create, open and save projects; import and export data; import and export
control points.

### Edit menu

![Edit menu](./docs/images/GUI-edit-menubar.jpg)

Undo and redo, clear points, and set the pixel size of each image. Each click is
one undoable step, as is each drag. Undo and redo are greyed out when there is
nothing to undo or redo. If the resolution is not set, both images are assumed
to have the same pixel size.

### View menu

![View menu](./docs/images/GUI-view-menubar.jpg)

Toggle point visibility and open the preview windows.

*View corrected image* overlays the warped source on the destination, with
sliders for the blend and — in 3D — for the slice and slicing axis. The 2D
preview offers three ways to compare:

| Mode | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `wipe` | Drag the sliders to sweep one image over the other. Best for checking a single edge. |
| `checkerboard` | Alternating squares from each image. Misalignment shows as features stepping sideways at every tile boundary. |
| `difference` | Absolute difference. A good alignment is black; whatever still glows did not line up. |

![Correction preview](./docs/images/GUI-preview.jpg)

*View matched points* shows both images side by side with lines joining matched
points, which makes bad correspondences obvious.

![Matched points](./docs/images/GUI-points.jpg)

### Auto menu

![Auto menu](./docs/images/GUI-auto-menubar.jpg)

Detect control points automatically with either SIFT or the pretrained
MatchAnything model.

![MatchAnything settings](./docs/images/GUI-auto-options.jpg)

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Num samples | Maximum number of matched points to return. |
| Enable RANSAC filtering | Reject correspondences inconsistent with a global transform. Leave on. |
| RANSAC method | `deformable` (default), `affine`, or `projective`. `deformable` and `projective` give broadly similar results; use `affine` only when you know the distortion is affine. |
| RANSAC threshold | 0.01–0.1 for `deformable` (normalized units), around 5.0 for `affine`/`projective` (pixels). |
| RANSAC max trials | Iterations. At least 100; raise it when the outlier rate is high. |

## Export formats and cropping

Exporting asks for a format and a cropping mode:

- **Destination cropping** produces output with the destination image's
  dimensions. Prefer this in most cases.
- **Source cropping** preserves the source grid. Use this for EBSD data,
  particularly DREAM.3D files, where the grid must be preserved. Set the
  resolution first so features end up at the same scale.

An `.ang` file can only be exported when the source data was loaded from one.

## Using tpsreg as a library

The registration core is importable and does not require a display:

```python
import numpy as np
from tpsreg import ThinPlateSplineTransform, transform_image

src = np.array([[10, 10], [10, 90], [90, 10], [90, 90], [50, 50]], dtype=float)
dst = np.array([[12, 11], [11, 88], [91, 13], [89, 92], [51, 49]], dtype=float)

# Fit a spline over a 100x100 destination grid.
tform = ThinPlateSplineTransform()
tform.estimate(src, dst, size=(100, 100))

# Or warp an image in one call.
warped = transform_image(image, src, dst, output_shape=(100, 100), order=1)
```

`tpsreg.ransac.ransac_filter` is available separately for rejecting outlier
correspondences.
